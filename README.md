# CSCI3155
This repository contains various topics and examples of my work in Principles of Programming Languages (PPL) at CU Boulder.

Over the course of the semester we will learn about programming languages in two ways.  
The first is by learning a multi-paradigm language called Scala. This language takes the best of object-oriented and functional programming to create a production-quality system for writing programs. We will use Scala to implement several of our own languages. We will also study some simple formal systems, espsecially towards the beginning of the course.  
These are the "Peter Pans" of the PL world: they are forever young, doing a job well and changing very little.  
Weâ€™ll learn interesting secrets from these deceptively simple collections of rules. Surprising secrets that we may realize we have known all along.
